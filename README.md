Project Title:
Bank Account Fraudulent Prediction: An Analytical Approach

Description:
This project aims to enhance fraud detection accuracy in bank transactions using machine learning techniques. Utilizing the Bank Account Fraud (BAF) dataset, it integrates diverse classification and clustering models to identify patterns in fraudulent activities and improve financial security.

Key Methods:
Data Cleaning & PCA: Improved model performance by reducing multicollinearity.
Classification Models: Logistic Regression, Random Forest, Naive Bayes, and Ensemble Learning for robust predictions.
Clustering Techniques: K-means and Gaussian Mixture Models to identify nuanced fraud patterns.
Interactive Visualizations: Used ROC curves, confusion matrices, and 3D cluster analysis for better model evaluation.
